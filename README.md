Setup: make sure you have bundler installed, and then you can execute the following:
- `bundle install` to install dependencies
- `bundle exec rake db:setup` to setup database (if you don't like the dev database)
- `rackup` to run server locally
- Or `rerun 'rackup -p 4567'` to run server and reload when changes are made
